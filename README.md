I created a project that uses a custom machine learning model to classify images uploaded by users on the interface. I implemented image scraping using the Fatkun Batch Download extension and OpenCV library for face and eye detection. To preprocess the data, I used NumPy and OpenCV and applied wavelet transformation for feature engineering. For building the model, I employed Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes algorithms and fine-tuned the model using GridSearchCV.
